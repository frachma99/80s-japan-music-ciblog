    <p>Welcome to 80's Japan Musicology+</p>
    <p>This Blog originally by me, Febri Rachmawati, in help with Youtube video tutorials and a few of random
        Google tutorials. This Blog also made based on my own interest and passion at 80's Japan music, along with my obligation through
        Smart Web Programming assignment.
        I tend to make it serious about this project. Begin from March 22 2020, i do it by myself. Fortunately, i am quite
        glad doing this project alone; even i am not that smart in Web Programming (and of course; another subject related to
        programming skills).</p>
